# ðŸŒ¼ Simple Iris Flower Prediction Web App (Using SVC & Flask)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a **very basic machine learning web app** built using **Python, Flask**, and the famous **Iris dataset**. It can predict the **type of Iris flower** just by entering 3 numbers â€” how cool is that?

We trained the model using **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)** and saved it using `pickle`. Then, we made a small website where users can give input and get instant predictions!

- It takes 3 flower measurements:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
- Predicts one of the 3 types of Iris flower:
  - **Setosa**
  - **Versicolor**
  - **Virginica**
- All done using a simple web page built with **HTML + Flask**
